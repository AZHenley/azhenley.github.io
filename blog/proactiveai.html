<p>I've been asking for and working on <b>proactive</b> AI coding tools for several years.</p>

<ul>
    <li>In 2019, I got a grant to research a <a href="inquisitivecodeeditor.html">code editor</a> that helps you overcome bugs before you know you have them.</li>
    <li>In 2021, I claimed that Stack Overflow had <a href="stackoverflow.html">all the data needed to build a model</a> that predicts what future problems a developer will face (and the solutions).</li>
    <li>In 2022, I proposed an <a href="aiterminal.html">AI terminal</a> that would fix your errors for you automagically.</li>
    <li>In 2022, my team designed and evaluated <a href="intellicode.html">50 user interfaces</a> for proactive code suggestions.</li>
    <li>In early 2023, shortly after ChatGPT came out, I argued that natural language is a <a href="naturallanguageui.html">lazy UI</a> and that good UIs <a href="trappedchat.html">guide and nudge</a> instead.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/chatuiunleashed.png" class="center" style="max-width:60%; border: 1px solid black;" alt="An AI chat interface that is interacting with the UI around it.">

<p>It is now 2025. What is the state of proactive tooling? Have agents taken over yet? Will my <a href="aiterminal.html">environment issues</a> automatically get resolved before I even see the error message? Can Cursor get TLS working properly for my vibe-coded app when I forget to set it up? Can Copilot <a href="copilotworkspace.html">interrupt me</a> before I go down a rabbit hole to fix the wrong thing?</p>

<p>No, not really.</p>

<p>But they can still proactively make suggestions about what code to change next.</p>

<img src="images/badgraytextsuggestion.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%; border: 1px solid black;" alt="A single-line gray text code suggestion that is redundant.">

<p>Or they can reactively make suggestions based on a prompt while using tools.</p>

<p>I just read a really interesting paper about the pros and cons of proactive AI coding tools that got me thinking about the topic again. (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713357">Assistance or Disruption? Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support</a>)</p>

<figcaption style="text-align:center"><small>Figure 1 from the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713357">paper</a> showing their system design dimensions.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They designed a proactive AI code tool, Codellaborator, that goes beyond typical gray-text suggestions by being strategic about the <i>timing</i>, the <i>visual</i> indicators, and the <i>scopes</i> of interaction for code suggestions.</p>

<p>It is just the tip of the iceberg though.</p>

<p>Why aren't the commercial tools in this space pushing harder on the user experience like this? They seem to be taking the shotgun approach: <i>more suggestions in more places and more often</i>. <b>But I don't want more suggestions!</b> I don't need more code thrown at me. I want a small number of high-value episodes of <i>assistance</i> as if a professional developer was sitting beside me.</p>

<p>Generating the next code change is great, but there is opportunity for so much more.</p>

<p>In fact, I <a href="copilotworkspace.html">previously</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>If I had a personal programmer that sat next to me, how would I work with them? Would I give them a sticky note with the task and wait for them to come back with the code for me to verify?
<br><br>
Or would we ask each other clarifying questions, point out significant details, discuss design tradeoffs, and show incremental progress as we work?</blockquote>

<p>Innovating on the user experience is hard, so instead, companies continue to ship an integration with <i>yet-another-model</i> that generates code.</p>
