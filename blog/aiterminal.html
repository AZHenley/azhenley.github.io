<p>How many times have you ran a command in your terminal, got an error message, Googled the error message, clicked on a Stack Overflow result, and then copy pasted the solution back into your terminal?</p>

<p>I do this <b>a lot</b>.</p>

<p>It is as if I am traversing a knowledge tree on Google or Stack Overflow, but in a manual and very tedious way. I'm often solving one symptom at a time and not seeing the underlying problem.</p>

<p>In fact, I wrote about this before, <a href="stackoverflow.html">Stack Overflow knows your future problem</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is hope! <i>A virtual assistant in your terminal powered by the crowd</i>.</p>

<p>At a high level, this system sees a command line error, automatically pulls the most relevant solution from Stack Overflow, presents it in the terminal, then runs it.</p>

<img src="images/aiterminal.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%;margin-bottom:-8px;">

<p>Let me break down the v1 approach in more details:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Monitor stdout/stderr for errors.</li>
    <li>If an error is detected, automatically and asynchronously look it up on Stack Overflow or other documentation pages.</li>
    <li>Filter potential solutions using contextual info (e.g., recent commands, OS, and preferred package manager).</li>
    <li>Extract the candidate solution.</li>
    <li>Sanitize and validate the solution (e.g., check for malicious scripts and prefer solutions that use already installed programs).</li>
    <li>Customize the solution for the user (e.g., replace paths and identifiers).</li>
    <li>Suggest to the user the potential fix and provide an explanation.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>But wait, there is more!</i></p>

<p>Although Stack Overflow is a good starting point, the system could be building its own <b>crowd-sourced decision tree</b>. As more users use the system and face similar errors, the system will be able to build a confidence level for each solution and identify the important variables (e.g., the version of a particular package). Large language models, such as Codex, can be used for refinement.</p>

<p>For example, the system can learn that to solve <i>Error #123</i> when running React for the first time, then you should <b>run</b> <i>Foobar -a -b</i> <b>if</b> you are on <i>macOS &gt;10.14</i> <b>and</b> have <i>NPM 8.19.2</i> installed, <b>else</b> you should <b>run</b>... and so on.</p>

<p>The system can preemptively know what errors you will have and can put together sequences of commands that will get you to the goal state more efficiently.</p>

<p>Additionally, it could help you rollback, generate documentation, export the suggestions to a script, or create a container so that these problems aren't an issue for you or your team in the future.</p> 

<hr>

<p>What's next? The basic concept works. There are problems to overcome: generalize the approach to more complex scenarios, fix corner cases, scale such that there is a crowd-sourced decision tree, and do so while enforcing security and privacy.</p>

<p>Don't worry, Clippy will be back!</p>
