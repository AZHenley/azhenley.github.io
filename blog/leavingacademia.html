<p>Yep, I'm leaving academia.</p>

<p>Recently, I resigned from my tenure-track faculty position.</p>

<p>It is an odd feeling. I went through 6.5 years of graduate school so that I could become a professor. Then I went through 3.5 years of being a professor to pursue tenure.</p>

<p>I've even been moderately successful at it. In fact, I did my mid-tenure review recently and received positive feedback.</p>

<p>My university, department, colleagues, and students have been fantastic.</p>

<p>Why am I leaving then?</p>

<p><b>I'm not happy.</b></p>

<p>I remember attending a new faculty symposium my first year where I asked a more senior professor, <i>"is it normal to think about going to industry every day?"</i></p>

<p>Based on their reaction, I guess it's not.</p>

<p>At first it came in waves. I thought I was just burnt out after my first semester. I wasn't surprised by that. I did <i>a lot</i> that first semester.</p>

<p>That feeling went away for a semester or so. Then it came back. Then it went away. Again and again.</p>

<p>But for the last year, it has been persistent. So I made up my mind to go to industry.</p>

<p>I've previously spent about two years time intermittently working in industry settings. I enjoyed the fast pace and working on problems that have a human on the other side waiting for your solution.</p>

<p>There is also a lot to enjoy about academia though. I'm glad I went the route I did. It taught me many <a href="lessonsfrommyphd.html">lessons</a>. The freedom and unstructured time to explore fuzzy problems is unmatched.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that I'll miss it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I want to learn some new skills. In particular, I've been craving to learn what it takes to ship a product from start to finish. I've been consuming every book and podcast I can find on entrepreneurship, product design, economics, and management.</p>

<p>What's next for me then? <i>Stay tuned...</i> ðŸ™‚ </p>
