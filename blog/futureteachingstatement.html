<p>Most teaching statements are <i>terrible</i>.</p>

<p>When applying for faculty positions, candidates have to submit an assortment of documents, which include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, research statement, and teaching statement, along with requesting others to write letters of reference on your behalf.</p>

<p>Out of these documents, the teaching statement seems to get the least attention, from the prospective professor writing it and from the hiring committee that is evaluating it.</p>

<p>Now that I have several years of teaching experience and have moved to industry, I've been reflecting on how I could be a better teacher (and how I should have written my teaching statement).</p>

<p>When I wrote my teaching statement in 2017, I aimed to convey:</p>

<ul>
<li>I actually do want to be a good teacher.</li>
<li>I taught a course before.</li>
<li>I've thought about how to be a better teacher.</li>
<li>Here are the topics I feel comfortable teaching.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it wasn't good. It was shallow. It didn't portray what it would actually be like for students taking my classes or even my high-level approach to teaching. It didn't show that I had a plan. I didn't know how to illustrate my excitement to teach. It was generic at best.</p>

<p>I can do a lot better.

<p>In my future teaching statement, I would aim to convey:</p>

<ul>
<li>I actually want to be a fantastic teacher.</li>
<li>I ran into challenges while teaching and adapted.</li>
<li>I found some things that worked well.</li>
<li>I care deeply about connecting to industry.</li>
<li>I want to teach outside the classroom too.</li>
</ul>

<p>But everyone says they want to be a good teacher. Everyone talks about using hip methods like active learning and flipped classrooms. Everyone says they want to prepare students for real-world situations.</p>

<p>How do I convey these points then? By demonstrating that I have invested considerable time into forming a plan with specific examples, even if they're outside the classroom, such as my experiences in industry, writing my blog, and from when I was a student. Now that I do have several years of classroom experience, I can also openly talk about what worked and, perhaps more importantly, what didn't work.</p>

<p>If someone genuinely cares about teaching, people will notice.</p>

<p>I went ahead and wrote my future teaching statement (<a href="../pubs/Henley2022Teaching.pdf">PDF</a>). For a point of comparison, here is my 2017 teaching statement (<a href="../pubs/Henley2017Teaching.pdf">PDF</a>). Is it good? Well, it is certainly better than my previous one! </p>

<p>I hope to continue teaching in various forms. What I have learned about industry is that there might be <i>more</i> opportunities to teach than as a professor! Maybe I can be an adjunct? Or write a book? Or organize a monthly meetup? Or work on an education product? Or shift to management? Or even start a YouTube channel? üë®‚Äçüè´ </p>
