<p>This is how I wish I could view changes to a document over time. But let's start from the beginning.</p>

<p>I keep everything in Dropbox. It's great. It was actually the first software that I ever paid for (<small>besides video games</small>). I think these automatically syncing cloud storage tools are one of the biggest advancements in software in a long time.</p>

<p>But there is one major issue of file management that it doesn't effectively help me with:</p>

<img src="images/fileversions.png" class="center" style="max-width:50%;">

<p>Does this look familiar? I sometimes duplicate files before I make big changes so that I can quickly go back in case I mess it up. I've even observed professional software engineers doing this with code files!</p>

<p>You might be thinking, but Dropbox and Google Docs automatically record each version and let you view them! Here is the version history of a PowerPoint slide deck I used for a lecture:</p>

<img src="images/dropboxversions.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%;">

<p>...but this is useless. Timestamps??? Tell me <b>what</b> changed! Let me <i>see</i> the changes over time. Word has a change tracking feature, but my PhD in computer science isn't enough for me to figure it out.</p>

<p>But but but Austin, you should be using a proper version control system! Just use Git and GitHub!</p>

<img src="images/githubbinarydiff.png" class="center" style="max-width:60%;">

<p>As you can see from this GitHub diff, popular file formats, like Word and PowerPoint, are not well supported.</p>

<p>Not only that, but requiring me to know which versions of my document to commit violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations">cognitive dimension</a> of premature commitment. Meaning that I often don't know when a version of a file will be important until I've already changed it (which is one reason why undo/redo is so popular). Luckily the cloud storage tools are smart enough to record changes and keep track of versions for us!</p>

<p>But the tools don't let us compare the versions.</p>

<p>That is why I built this prototype several years ago that I call Yester.</p>

<img src="images/yester.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%;">

<p>It lets me <i>scrub</i> through the timeline, just like a YouTube video. It supports a side-by-side view of the current version with the currently selected previous version. The prototype uses the Dropbox API to get all of the versions of a file. If I ever have more time I'd love to turn it into an Electron app with support for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDFs that would be free for the world to use.</p>

<p>So why isn't this built directly into Dropbox, Google Docs, and Microsoft Office?</p>

<p>If Drew Houston is reading this: I have many more ideas on how to make file management better. Reach out to me and we can discuss them :)</p>
