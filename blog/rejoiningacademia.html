<p>I am rejoining academia.</p>

<p>The last few years have been a whirlwind of life events.</p>

<p>I <a href="leavingacademia.html">left</a> my faculty position at University of Tennessee in early 2022 after 3.5 years. The stars had aligned for me to get that job, and I really enjoyed it, but I ultimately wasn't happy. It was probably some mixture of burn out, "the grass is always greener", and questioning my impact.</p>

<p>Then I <a href="leavingmicrosoft.com">left</a> my dream job as a researcher at Microsoft in 2023. Again, I enjoyed it and was successful there. But the voice in the back of my head wouldn't go away, questioning the impact I was having.</p>

<p>Then the startup I joined as CTO was <a href="acquiredin99days.html">acquired</a> months later. It was a blast. I learned more each day than any other job I've ever had. I stuck around for a few months with the company that acquired us before taking a much needed break.

<p>Now, I'm going <b>back to academia!</b></p>

<p>I've joined Carnegie Mellon University as an Associate Teaching Professor in the Software & Societal Systems Department and School of Computer Science.</p>

<img src="images/pittskyline.jpg" class="center" style="max-width:80%; border-radius:15px;">

<p>I miss teaching, being surrounded by students that I can learn from, the freedom to work on wacky side projects, and the smell of campus on a fall afternoon.</p>

<p>And where better than CMU?</p>
