<p>AI code suggestions in code editors, such as Copilot and Visual Studio IntelliCode, are fairly common place now.</p>

<img src="images/graytextsuggestion.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%;" alt="Screenshot of a typical gray-text code suggestion that is autocompleting an IF statement.">

<p>What is the optimal way to present these code suggestions to users? Showing the suggestion as inline gray text is common. But are there better ways? What if it is a multi-line change that modifies existing code?</p>

<p>These are the questions we wanted to answer.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>We iteratively explored 50 or so designs for inline code change interfaces in Visual Studio. We filtered our designs down to 19 which we then tested in a series of 7 lab studies involving 61 developers.</p>

<img src="images/intellicodestudymethod.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%;" alt="Illustration of our methodology: multiple parallel designs, filtered through voting, user testing, merging the best ideas, sensemaking, repeat.">

<p>The lab studies involved small coding tasks like adding a new property or refactoring. The developers were not informed of the AI code suggestion tool. We used Visual Studio's <i>lightbulb</i> as a baseline interface, where an icon by the line of code pops up and can be clicked to view suggestions.</p> 

<img src="images/lightbulbsuggestions.png" class="center" style="max-width:80%;" alt="Screenshot of a lightbulb after being clicked on to expand the suggestion menu.">


<p>Finally, we conducted a large-scale deployment of the two most promising designs in Visual Studio 2022. One design was released in a public release and the other in an opt-in preview release.</p>

<h3>Designs</h3>

<p>We explored interfaces for three types of interfaces: additive changes, single-line changes, and multi-line changes.</p>

<p><b>Additive change suggestions</b> can involve inserting new code at one or multiple places. We re-used gray text for this:</p>

<img src="images/insertcodesuggestions.png" class="center" style="max-width:90%;" alt="Screenshot of a gray-text suggestion that is inserting code into two non-adjacent lines of code.">

<p><b>Single-line change suggestions</b> can involve adding or deleting tokens on a single line. We tried numerous ways to present this, such as gray text, strike-through, side-by-side diffs, and in-place diffs. Four designs are shown below:</p>

<p><b>Multi-line change suggestions</b> can involve adding or deleting tokens on multiple lines. We tried different variations of the single-line designs for this. Four designs are shown below:</p>

<img src="images/multilinecodesuggestions.png" class="center" style="max-width:98%;" alt="Four different designs of multi-line change suggestions.">

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>There were a <i>a lot</i> of results from these studies so I'll summarize some highlights:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The baseline (clickable lightbulb) was almost never clicked or noticed.</li>
    <li>Developers liked small gray-text suggestions (similar to Copilot) though one developer questioned how much time it actually saved.</li>
    <li>Developers said they won't accept suggestions that are not fully visible onscreen.</li>
    <li>Developers were not willing to click to expand a large suggestion.</li>
    <li>Developers preferred diff views over gray text or strike-through for both single-line and multi-line suggestions.</li>
    <li>Developers wanted to see the original code and the suggestion simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Developers found that too many large suggestions distracting.</li>
    <li>Developers did not like the designs that interweaved suggestions with their original code.</li>
    <li>Developers did not like the designs that used a popup window.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the field deployment, we released two designs. (1) An inline additive interface that uses gray text which led to a <b>3.5x increase</b> in usage. (2) An inline single-line interface that uses a diff view which led to a <b>176% increase</b> in accepted suggestions from <b>29% more</b> users.</p>

<h3>Design principles for inline code suggestions</h3>

<p>Through all our interviews and user studies, we inductively came up with five design principles for inline code suggestions:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Glanceable suggestions.</b> Suggestions should be proactively visible to the user to make it easy to discover and take action.</li>
    <li><b>Juxtaposition.</b> The suggestion should explicitly indicate and juxtapose the existing code affected by the suggestion and the proposed code to improve user comprehension and support quick action.</li>
    <li><b>Simplicity through familiarity.</b> Reusing existing familiar interface elements to indicate proposed changes reduces visual clutter, improves comprehension, and reduces cognitive load.</li>
    <li><b>Sufficient visibility for validation.</b> The users should be able to see the whole suggestion when taking the action to prevent premature-commitment.</li>
    <li><b>Snoozability of suggestions.</b> The user should be able to snooze inline suggestions to prevent interruptions.</li>
</ul>
