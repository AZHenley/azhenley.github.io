	<h1 class="blogtitle">Faculty interview questions I asked and got asked</h1>
	<small>5/14/2018</small><br><br>

    <p>This is a list of questions I asked and got asked during phone and campus interviews for tenure-track Assistant Professor positions in Computer Science during the 2017-2018 interview season. Many of the existing resources for the job market focus on application materials and the job talk, but I had no idea what to expect during the interviews, so I wrote these down.</p>

    <p>I applied to 36 positions, did 10 phone interviews, was invited to 8 campus interviews, and received 7 offers. Most of these universities were R1 state schools and ranked in the 60s-70s by US News. I attended an R2 university with an unranked department.</p>

    <h3>Questions I got asked</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Tell us about your research.</li>

        <li>What are the contributions of your work?</li>

        <li>Can you explain the theory behind your work?</li>

        <li>How does your research relate to <i>X</i>? (where <i>X</i> is something I've never heard of in a very different domain)</li>

        <li>How is your work different than other's in your field?</li>

        <li>How will you distinguish yourself from your advisor?</li>

        <li>What resources do you need for your lab?</li>

        <li>Why this university?</li>

        <li>What are you looking for in a department?</li>

        <li>What other schools are you interviewing with? (some beat around the bush, others were blunt)</li>
