<p><small><i>Update 5/24: See the discussion of this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27256867">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/njcpxt/why_i_prefer_making_useless_stuff/">Reddit</a>.</i></small></p>

<p>I get a lot of responses like this about spending time on <a href="challengingprojects.html">useless</a> projects. But you know what?</p>
	
<p><b>There is nothing I find more liberating than to spend a Saturday afternoon coding on some toy project.</b></p> 

<p>There is no expectation or obligation to ever become more. It is just for fun, learning, and curiousity. I can add whatever features I want. I can use whatever technologies I want. I can throw it all away if I want. <b>These</b> are the projects I <i>yearn</i> for and look forward to when I'm busy with <i>work</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps George Bernard Shaw was on to something: <i>"We don't stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing."</i></p>

<p>Funny enough, Titus Barik published a <a href="http://static.barik.net/barik/publications/vlhcc2017/PID4950171.pdf">paper</a> that contributes a qualitative analysis on the sentiment of programming and play on Hacker News. The themes he found include play as artistry, catalyst, fun, playgrounds, spontaneity, tinkering, and anti-work. There is a quote that I particularly like, <i>"The joy of programming for programming's sake is something you do in your own time."</i></p>

<p>It all makes sense to me, because I have spent a <i>lot</i> of time building useless stuff. Mostly compilers and game engines. To name a few projects:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nash, a low-resolution HTML5 game engine with no dependencies</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/azhenley/wiggleface">Wiggleface</a>, a very low-resolution game engine using Pygame</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/azhenley/harvestmemory">HarvestMemory</a>, a game where you code a bot in an assembly-like language</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/azhenley/knox">Knox</a>, a compiler for my own language that overemphasizes "explicitness"</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/azhenley/cosine">cosine</a>, an implementation of cosine from scratch</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/azhenley/sirdrcaptain">SirDrCaptain</a>, yet another static website generator that no one uses</li>
    <li><a href="">goforth</a>, a bad implementation of the Forth language</li>
    <li>CHIP-8 virtual machines, I think I have made a dozen of them</li>
    <li>Darkest Days, a remake of my favorite Flash game</li>
</ul>

<p>And if those aren't enough, I have several more useless projects planned! I can't wait to get started on them:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A typed Lisp compiler with a focus on performance</li>
    <li>An interpreter for my own language that feels like old-school PHP plus dataflow programming</li>
    <li>A "better" CHIP-8 that supports networking and sound</li>
    <li>Two different todo list apps for iOS</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever you do, don't forget Bob Dylan's wise words about the things you enjoy doing: <i>"you're gonna have to serve somebody"</i>.</p>
