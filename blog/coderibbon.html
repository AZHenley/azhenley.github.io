<p><i>TL;DR: Developers spend a lot of time navigating code, so I spent the last 8 years building tools to make code navigation more efficient. I'll share some design principles that we learned along the way. If you want to try out our latest tool, my student recently released an open source Atom plugin, <a href="https://utk-se.github.io/CodeRibbon/">CodeRibbon</a>.</i></p>

<p><small><i>See the discussion of this post on Reddit's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lx4xao/navigate_your_code_like_its_2021/">/r/programming</a>.</i></small></p>

<hr>

<p>Empirical studies found that developers spend 35-50% of their time just navigating code<sup>1,2</sup>. Many of these navigations are wasted though, given that 50% of them yielded less information than developers expected and 40% required more effort than predicted<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Search is not a great solution either, since it is rarely used<sup>1,4</sup>, time consuming for developers to process the results<sup>2</sup>, most navigations are to recently visited code<sup>1,5</sup>, and often leads to irrelevant code<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Before I show you our open source tool for navigating code, let me tell you the 8-year journey that it has taken to get here. From Patchworks to CodeRibbon!</p>

<h3>Initial design: Patchworks</h3>

<p>Back in 2013, I was brainstorming ideas for my Master's project with my advisor, <a href="http://sdflem.github.io/">Scott Fleming</a>. He had been researching how developers seek information and suggested designing a new code editor that doesn't have tabbed documents.</p>

<img src="images/codebubbles.png" class="center" style="max-width:65%;">

<p>The most relevant tool I could find was <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/codebubbles/#:~:text=Code%20Bubbles%20is%20a%20working,and%20is%20under%20active%20development.">Code Bubbles</a>, pictured above. It made headlines a few years earlier<sup>6</sup> by introducing a novel interface that aimed to fix several of the issues we were now looking at: it enables efficient juxtaposition of code, reduces scrolling, eliminates tabs, etc. It does so by allowing you to open individual functions in free-floating bubbles on a large two-dimensional canvas. You can pan around this large space as if you are viewing Google Maps.</p>

<p>We worried this was too much freedom, so we added constraints: a fixed grid of code documents on a one-dimensional ribbon.</p>

<img src="images/patchworksconcept.png" class="center" style="max-width:50%;">

<p>The idea is that you view multiple pieces of code on-screen by default. Once your screen is full, you <i>shift</i> the ribbon either left or right. The ribbon extends to infinity and functions roughly as a timeline of all the code you have previously viewed. You can also rearrange the open code documents by dragging them around, or you can double click on one to go into full-screen.</p>

<p>A screenshot of one of my prototypes can be seen below. It was built with C# and WPF as a standalone editor. It had just enough features to  conduct some preliminary studies.</p>

<p>You can also zoom out to view more of your ribbon:</p>

<h3>Patchworks wins!</h3>

<p>When compared to Eclipse and Code Bubbles, we found that developers spent less time navigating, made fewer navigation mistakes, and spent less time arranging their open code documents while using Patchworks<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<p>There was a flurry of interest in Patchworks. Developers from Google and Microsoft emailed me asking where they can download it. Companies asked me to integrate the design into their software. Recruiters asked if I wanted an internship.</p>

<p>Sadly, it was just a research prototype that I'd be far too embarrassed to let anyone use outside of the lab.</p>

<h3>Patchworks goes industrial</h3>

<p>Next I implemented Patchworks into the proprietary LabVIEW development environment. We thought it could be particularly useful for LabVIEW since the code is visual and takes up a lot of screen space. National Instruments was very generous in supporting my research and giving me access to their source code and engineers.</p>

<img src="images/patchworkslabview.png" class="center" style="max-width:60%;">

<p>At this point, I knew the world needed Patchworks!</p>

<h3>Design guidelines for any editor</h3>

<p>After conducting a lab study with professional engineers<sup>8</sup>, we came up with a set of design principles that can be applied to virtually any code editor:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Juxtaposition principle:</b> Enable efficient (re)arranging of multiple open code documents side by side on screen at a time.</li>
    <li><b>Signpost principle:</b> Thumbnails/summaries/labels of open code documents must provide sufficient information to quickly make effective navigation decisions.</li>
    <li><b>Blowup principle:</b> Enable efficient toggling of an open code document within a multi-document view to an enlarged, possible single-document, view.</li>
    <li><b>Cleanup principle:</b> Enable efficient closing of open code documents that are not currently relevant and causing clutter.</li>
    <li><b>Heterogeneity principle:</b> Apply the above principles to all types of frequently visited documents, not only code (e.g., program output and documentation).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have students still pushing towards a generalized set of design principles for code editors, so stay tuned.</p>

<h3>A free and open source tool: CodeRibbon</h3>

<p>Fast forward to modern times. My PhD student, <a href="https://unhexium.net/ll/">Ben Klein</a>, has been implementing and extending the Patchworks concept as an Atom plugin called CodeRibbon. It has more features and is <i>very sleek</i>.</p>

<img src="images/coderibbon.gif" class="center" style="max-width:80%; margin-bottom: 8px;">

<p>It supports the original ribbon concept, but also lets you reconfigure your grid size and supports all sorts of shortcuts to maximize productivity.</p>

<img src="images/coderibbon2.gif" class="center" style="max-width:80%; margin-bottom:8px;">

<p>You can check out the CodeRibbon <a href="https://utk-se.github.io/CodeRibbon/">website</a>, the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/utk-se/CodeRibbon/">repo</a>, and go download the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/code-ribbon">plugin</a> to try yourself.</p>

<p>Let us know if you have any feedback!</p>
