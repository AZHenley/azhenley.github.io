	<small>6/17/2021</small><br><br>

<p>I was recently on the Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/15/podcast-347-information-foraging-the-tactics-great-developers-use-to-find-solutions/">podcast</a> discussing our research on Information Foraging Theory (see my blog <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/informationforaging.html">post</a>). I had a lot of fun chatting with them, and it got me thinking about how I'd apply some of our findings to the Stack Overflow website. I talked briefly about this at the end of the podcast, so I'll expand on that idea here.</p>

<iframe height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://player.simplecast.com/1febb341-61c1-4e25-b034-d9d8a3c79f80?dark=false"></iframe>

<p>Recently, I was installing React Native on my new work laptop. This is usually straightforward, just run a few terminal commands. But I got an error. Then another. And another.</p>

<p>My process went like this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Read React Native's guide for setting up the development environment.</li>
    <li>Copy and paste command into terminal and get error.</li>
    <li>Copy and paste error message into Google.</li>
    <li>Follow the first Stack Overflow result's top answer.</li>
    <li>Rejoice that I fixed <i>that</i> problem.</li>
    <li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p>This happened over and over. I still have no idea what was the root cause of all the issues.</p>

<p>But it got me thinking... surely I am not the only person that had this sequence of problems. And Stack Overflow already has data on what questions people view and when they view it.</p>

<p>What if Stack Overflow could help you get to the <i>next</i> relevant question and answer?</p>

<img src="images/soclippy.png" class="center" style="max-width:70%;">

<p>I want Stack Overflow to recommend what problems I'll have in the future to reduce the ping ponging I do between my terminal and browser, or to eliminate it entirely by helping me see the big picture problem.</p>

<p>The sidebar currently provides suggestions for similar questions, but they often seem like duplicates or too unrelated.</p>

<img src="images/sosidebar.png" class="center" style="max-width:30%;">

<p>Let's go a step further from just individual recommendations though: A cluster of sequential questions could be generated automatically (or crowdsourced!) into <i>playlists</i> of questions. They certainly have the user data from me viewing a different question every 5 minutes that is on a similar topic before I navigate away.</p>

<p>Now tutorials and documentation could embed/link to these playlists which can naturally evolve and improve over time, and this keeps with the wiki-style that Stack Overflow wanted from Q/A.</p>

<p>This applies to a lot more domains than just installing software or following a tutorial. My Stack Overflow usage almost always involves this back-and-forth behavior and requires multiple answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Stack Overflow is <b>great</b> for solving specific problems, but imagine how much more it could do! Don't even get me started on how snippets from Stack Overflow answers could be integrated into code editors.</p>
