<p>I can't.</p>

<p>I tried. And then I tried two more times.</p>

<img src="images/appwithgoogling.png" class="center" style="max-width:75%;">

<p>I wanted to test my mastery of Node.js and my reliance on Google and Stack Overflow, so I set out on an adventure to make a todo list web app without touching any external resource for help. <b>I just couldn't do it.</b> To be fair, I'm not a web developer so I'm not entirely shocked by this. I only have the itch (and time) to throw together a small web app about once every 6 months.</p>

<p>But this got me thinking. How many people out there, especially professional web developers, <i>can</i> do this?</p>

<p>It isn't to say that you <i>should</i> be able to. But it is an interesting thing to study. At what point is relying on Google a detriment to the performance of a software developer? Or even deeper, does an over-reliance on documentation indicate a lack of critical expertise that will ultimately result in considerably lower job performance? And I don't mean the need to look up an occasional command or an obscure error message. </p>

<p>It reminds me of technical interviews and Leetcode-style problems where you are expected to code up a solution quickly and often without a search engine. Maybe there <i>is</i> something to say about what it is measuring. <small>(Don't get me wrong, technical interviews are still very <a href="https://www.chrisparnin.me/pdf/interviews-HN.pdf">broken</a> and aren't ecologically valid.)</small></p>

<p>In fact, researchers have been studying the effect of timed, repeated exercises for software engineering students, much like you would train an athlete. A study over 4 years with 286 students did indeed have some positive results on learning outcomes (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3344273">Design and Evaluation of an "Athletic" Approach to Software Engineering Education</a>). Another research group looked at frequent, timed skill assessments that ranged from setting up a Ruby on Rails web app to adding user authentication to a web app. Their results indicate their assessments may be a far better assessment than traditional homework assignments (<a href="Frequent, Timed Coding Tests for Training and Assessment of Full-Stack Web Development Skills: An Experience Report">Frequent, Timed Coding Tests for Training and Assessment of Full-Stack Web Development Skills: An Experience Report</a>).</p>

<p>Maybe I need to expand my workouts to include small coding exercises? Who knows.</p>

<p>Give the challenge a shot: can you make a basic web app without googling?</p>
