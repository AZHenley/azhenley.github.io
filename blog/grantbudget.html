<p>Until I wrote my first grant proposal, I knew very little about what a federal research grant pays for.</p>

<p>I'll share what my grants covered and the reasoning behind it. Note: I was a computer science professor researching software engineering at a large state university in the US, primarily funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>

<p>TLDR: Each of my grant budgets included the university's cut, a fraction of a month of salary for me per year, a graduate student, conference travel for both of us, and a very small amount to conduct user studies. This amounts to a little under <b>$100,000 per year</b> per grant.</p>

</figure>

<p>I'll go into detail of each of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The university's cut</li>
    <li>My summer salary</li>
    <li>Graduate students</li>
    <li>Travel</li>
    <li>Other: equipment, undergrads, user studies</li>
</ul>


<h3>The university's cut</h3>

<p>People seem shocked to find out that the university takes a portion of every grant, and even more so when they hear the percentage that they take.</p>

<p>For every $1 I budgeted for my research, I had to account for an <b>additional $0.53</b> that would go to the university. Universities have a pre-specified percentage for overhead (also called facilities and administrative (F&A) costs or indirect costs). Equipment and tuition are excluded from the overhead calculation. It supposedly covers things like having a building to work in, electricity, basic computer equipment, and support staff. It is split amongst the university, college, and department. These F&A rates seem to only ever go up...</p>

<p>A very small amount of this money will sometimes trickle back down to the researcher.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, my last grant was <b>$481,112</b> of which <b>$139,022</b> was budgeted to go to the university for overhead.</p>


<h3>My summer salary</h3>

<p>Yes, professors get to pocket some of their grants! Though that is because they are often only guaranteed 9 months of salary despite working the entire year.</p>

<p>It is typical to pay yourself 0.5 to 1 month of salary per grant. Specifically, my three NSF grants covered 0.55, 0.75, and 1.0 months of my salary for each year. I found it funny that my college factored in annual raises into the budget that were always far higher than I actually received.</p>

<p><b>A very stressful part of faculty life was knowing that my annual compensation was about to take a nose dive if I don't get another grant.</b></p>

<p>More grants is generally better, though there are restrictions on your salary. Most notably, the NSF restricts you to 2 months of salary from all of your active NSF grants at any given time. Even if you have other funding sources, you can't have more than 12 months of salary.</p>

<p>What do you do if you're swimming in funding then? You can buy out of teaching. You effectively pay for the cost of an adjunct to take your teaching load.</p>


<h3>Graduate students</h3>

<p>The largest component of my grants was supporting a graduate student. They're the ones doing the bulk of the daily work. It includes their salary ($2200 a month), tuition ($15,000 a year), and benefits ($200 a month). Approximately <b>$233,000</b> of <b>$481,112</b> from my last grant was for a graduate student for 5 years.</p>

<p>There are ways to stretch this further. For example, many of my graduate students also worked as teaching assistants during the school year which covered their tuition, benefits, and a portion of their salary, so I just had to pay the difference in salary. Though it did eat a nontrivial amount of their time and attention. Moreover, my graduate students often won fellowships/scholarships that boosted their salary to a more sustainable wage.</p>


<h3>Travel</h3>

In computer science, conferences are a vital way to network and share research. It is also often required once a paper has been accepted for publication, so I budget for one trip per year for both myself and a graduate student. I budgeted for alternating between domestic and international travel every other year. Something like $2300 for domestic per person and $3300 for international per person. It covers airfare, food, conference registration (silly expensive!), and hotel.


<h3>Other</h3>

<p>The only other cost I included were <b>incentive payments</b> to participants in our user studies, which were quite small: $600ish per year to pay 15 participants.</p>

<p>It is also common to budget for <b>undergraduate researchers</b> as hourly employees. The NSF makes it easy to add-on to grants for this later through "NSF REU Supplements". I hired many undergrads, though I always used my startup fund.</p>

<p>What about <b>equipment</b>? Considering I work in software, all I or my students ever really needed were just typical computers so my equipment budget was $0. The NSF expects such equipment to be covered by the F&A costs. It is common for researchers in other other fields to budget for expensive, specialized equipment though.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you don't spend the money, it goes back to the government. You can request a "no-cost extension" from the NSF that seems to be automatically approved (at least the first time) that gives you an additional year to wrap things up. I did this. You also have some wiggle room to move funds between the budgeted categories which I put unneeded stress on myself to not do.</p>

<p>My budgets are probably as simple as they get. They really aren't difficult to understand once you learn the jargon.</p>
