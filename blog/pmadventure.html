<p>A year and a half ago, I <a href="leavingacademia.html">left academia</a> and started as a program manager at Microsoft.</p>

<p>But before that, I had no idea what a PM was or what they did. I had virtually no exposure to the role. I had never worked with one, never learned about them in my college classes, and didn't know how they interacted with other roles. I really knew nothing about being a PM!</p>

<p>I only had experience as a software developer and as a researcher. In my mind, those roles have well-defined definitions with tangible deliverables. Software developers take requirements and produce software. Researchers take an unknown and produce knowledge.</p>

<p>What does a PM do?</p>

<p>During my interviews, I asked several PMs how they defined it. Some of the responses I got were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The customer's advocate</li>
<li>The facilitator between engineers, business, and customers</li>
<li>The producer of clarity amidst ambiguity</li>
<li>The creator of the product's vision</li>
<li>The product's gatekeeper</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I have been in this role for over a year, I've seen that there is no single role that is PM. It is different for each product, team, and individual.</p>

<p>I've seen PMs execute in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write feature specifications</li>
<li>Establish the product roadmap</li>
<li>Rapidly build prototypes</li>
<li>Design the user experience</li>
<li>Conduct user research</li>
<li>Analyze telemetry and feedback</li>
<li>Define goals and metrics (OKRs and KPIs)</li>
<li>Understand the competition</li>
<li>Track and prioritize tasks</li>
<li>Present updates to leadership</li>
<li>Evangelize to customers</li>
<li>Maintain communication with partner teams</li>
</ul>

<p>People get frustrated that the role is so broad and doesn't always have tangible deliverables (e.g., lines of code), but I'm learning that is actually the power of a PM. They get to adapt to the situation to move the product forward. Each week can be wildly different.</p>

<p>It really is a <i>choose-your-own-adventure</i> role.</p>

<p>A few books I'd recommend for anyone interested in product management:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Design of Everyday Things (<a href="https://amzn.to/3CTUmIB">Amazon</a>)</li>
    <li>The Lean Startup (<a href="https://amzn.to/3PGudof">Amazon</a>)</li>
    <li>The Customer-Driven Playbook (<a href="https://amzn.to/3pyg4yP">Amazon</a>)</li>
    <li>The Tyranny of Metrics (<a href="https://amzn.to/3PGuqrx">Amazon</a>)</li>
</ul>
