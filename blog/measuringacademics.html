<p>Academia involves a lot of bean counting. Typical ways to measure professors include grant funding, published papers, impact factor, conference rankings, citations, i10-index, h-index, students graduated, course evaluations, invited talks, committees, and so forth.</p>

<p>I propose a few alternatives that might even be more useful:</p>

<h3>Candy bar index</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number of times students mention treats (e.g., candy or pizza) in course evaluations.</li>
<li>It can either mean the instructor likes their students or it can mean they are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00986280701700318">bribing</a> them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jurisprudential metric</h3>
<ul>
<li>Average length of syllabi.</li>
<li>A syllabus says a lot about the instructor. More than 15 pages and you are a lawyer attempting to write loophole-less contracts. <small>The longest I've seen is 32 pages.</small></li>
</ul>

<h3>Good number</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number of favorable recommendation letters written.</li>
<li>Writing strong letters for students can take considerable effort and is often invisible to everyone else. Protect those with high good numbers!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ramble rating</h3>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of all words spoken at a faculty meeting.</li>
<li>Consider muting anyone with a ramble rating of 10% or higher.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dean factor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hours in meetings per week.</li>
<li>If their dean factor is sustainably over 20, then they have become an administrator (or they have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/">another</a> job).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Innovation adoption score (IAS)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number of CSS rules on their website.</li>
<li>Computer science faculty are notorious for their black-and-white, HTML-only websites. Given that CSS is only 20 years old, some professors are still adopting the new technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>X differential</h3>
<ul>
<li>Number of tweets during the semester minus number of tweets during breaks.</li>
<li>Do they advocate for science only during workdays or year round? Be leery of anyone with a large X differential, whether it is a positive or negative score, or if it is zero.</li>
</ul>
