<p>Time sure does fly.</p>

<p>This is my 100th blog post! I started blogging regularly in June 2019 and have tried to write at least once a month since then. <small>It pains me greatly when I miss a month...</small></p>

<p>I have always really, really enjoyed reading technical blogs. People like <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/">Matt Might</a>, <a href="https://ericlippert.com">Eric Lippert</a>, <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net">Eli Bendersky</a>, and many <a href="technicalblogs.html">more</a>. I'd visit their website once or twice a week hoping for something new. Every night before bed I read a few.</p>

<p>It made me want to write my own. But what would I write about?! Who would care what I have to say? How embarrassing and cringey will my content be? At some point, I convinced myself to just try it. That first <a href="typeinference.html">post</a> generated immediate buzz with a bunch of comments saying I don't know what I'm talking about <small>(which is true)</small>.</p>

<p>It was fun. I kept writing. Now I can't imagine not writing. <i>"Writing is thinking"</i> or so they say. Over these 6 years, the 100 posts have amassed 5 million views and thousands of comments. The most viewed posts are:</p>

</ol>

<p>By far the most popular is the first <i>Challenging</i> post. Even 5+ years later, it is still being viewed hundreds of times a day. What I find funny is how different the <i>Challenging</i> series is from the rest of my writing, yet those are the ones that perform the best. I'm really bad at predicting which posts will be popular.</p>

<p>A few noteworthy posts stand out in my mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Most time-consuming to write:</b> <a href="teenytinycompiler1.html">Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler</a> (series)</li>
	<li><b>Second most time-consuming to write:</b> <a href="cosine.html">Implementing cosine in C from scratch</a></li>
	<li><b>Most creative:</b> <a href="hofstadter.html">Hofstadter: An esoteric programming language with concurrency, regex, and web requests</a></li>
	<li><b>Favorite coding project:</b> <a href="superoptimizer.html">My first superoptimizer</a></li>
	<li><b>Best story:</b> <a href="solvingunknownproblems.html">Building solutions to problems that no one knows exist yet</a></li>
	<li><b>Most comments:</b> <a href="11000lines.html">The project with a single 11,000-line code file</a></li>
	<li><b><s>Most negative comments:</s></b> On second thought, let's not revisit those ðŸ˜Š</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, I have many more posts <a href="notyetwritten.html">left</a>. Better get to writing.</p>
